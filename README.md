## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

The main objectif of this little mod was to add a challenging and fun fight in Firkraag's hideout.

I like Baldur's Gate a lot, and I wrote this mod (first version in 2010) to become a minimum familiar with some modding stuffs. Thanks to Freddy_Gwendo, the BuTcHeRy is now compatible with the Enhanced Editions, EET and BGT. I also added a few improvements.

Secondary objectives are:

- Allow players to fight in a big room or large space because it is really boring and frustrating to fight in a corridor, especially in BG2.
- Bring BG2 as close as possible to a *Dungeon crawler* game.
- Difficulty level scaling: difficulty will be adjusted according to the game difficulty level which can be set in the Gameplay subsection of the Options menu. (more info <a href="#components">below</a>)
- Spice up many battles by turning them into 'butchery fights', with a few spawns and respawns.
- Make a few non-spellcaster creatures a bit more challenging (while non cheated) using kit abilities, having proficiencies in weapons, etc.
- Have challenging and charismatic boss (Tazok, DigDag, Sarevok).
- Keep 100% content of the original game. I add a few things, but I don't remove a single one.
- Add a bit of fun dialogues and cutscenes.
- No big loots or new magical items.
- Have 100% compatibility and optimisation with Stratagems and Item Revisions (especially with its '*potions revisions*' component).<br><br>

## <a name="compat" id="compat"></a>Compatibility

#### Games supported

This mod is designed to work on the following Infinity Engine games:

- Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition (BG2EE).
- The original Baldur's Gate II (BG2, or just SoA) with the Throne of Bhaal (ToB) expansion. **Make sure you have Throne of Bhaal patched to version 26498.** Check the ReadMe files related to your patch in your game folder and the <a href="http://www.bioware.com/games/throne_bhaal/support/patches/">BioWare</a> website if necessary.
- The conversion projects based on ToB: <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/forum/261-bgt-weidu">Baldur's Gate Trilogy (BGT)</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Gibberlings3/EET/releases">Enhanced Edition Trilogy</a> (EET).

## 

#### Other Mods Compatibility

This is a WeiDU mod, and therefore should be compatible with all WeiDU mods. Though I am striving to make BuTcHeRy compatible with as many other mods as possible, there is always a chance that incompatibilities will arise. Below are the ones discovered thus far:

- BuTcHeRY is not compatible with Revisited Battles component '*Improved Firkraag*' (don't expect a crash but an impossible fight).

If you encounter any bugs, please <a href="https://www.baldursgateworld.fr/lacouronne/butchery/">report them on the mod forum!</a>

## 

#### Installation Order

>Classical games players are strongly recommended to download and install the latest version of the <a href="https://www.gibberlings3.net/mods/fixes/bg2fixpack/">BG2 Fixpack</a> before proceeding with the installation of this mod.<br>

Here is the recommended installation order:
- Please install BuTcHeRY after TobEx, BG2 Fixpack, and EET.
- Please install BuTcHeRY before any final "biffing" routines.


:warning: As I use vanilla scripts, you can further increase the difficulty if you install the Stratagems mod ('*Smarter general AI*' component). The first components are to be installed before Stratagems for a better experience and difficulty while the other components are to be installed after Stratagems (all this is detailed before the installation of each component).

RECOMMENDATION : you should also install the "<a href="http://www.mediafire.com/file/b9mtiwvj4aah42r/Derats_AutoRest_v4.zip/file">auto resting</a>" mod (from deratiseur) that allows you to restore your spells without having to rest for 8 hours. :wink:

## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

*If you've previously installed the mod, remove it before extracting the new version. To do this, run __setup-butchery.exe__, un-install all previously installed components and delete the :file_folder: __butchery__ folder.*

*When installing or un-installing, __do not close the DOS window__ by clicking on the __X__ button! Instead, press the __Enter__ key whenever instructed to do so.*

*__Disable any antivirus__ or other memory-resident software before installing this or any other mod. Some (particularly avast and Norton!) have a tendency to report false positives with mod activity, resulting in failed installs.*

You can extract files from the archive using <a href="https://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, <a href="https://zipgenius.com/">ZipGenius</a> or another file compression utility that handles .zip files.

## 

#### Enhanced Editions Note

The Enhanced Editions are actively supported games. Please note that every patch update will wipe your current mod setup! If in the middle of a modded game you might want to delay the patch update (if possible) as even after reinstalling the mods, you might not be able to continue with your old savegames. Alternatively, copy the whole game's folder into a new one that can be modded and will stay untouched by game patches. It is important that you install the mod to the language version you are playing the game in. Otherwise, the dialogues of the mod will not show but give error messages.

## 

#### Windows

BuTcHeRy for Windows is distributed as an extractable compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (*the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file*). On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: butchery folder and a setup-butchery.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-butchery.exe`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-butchery.exe`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change components.

## 

#### Mac OS

BuTcHeRy for Mac OS is distributed in the same compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

First, extract the files from the archive into your game directory. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: butchery folder, setup-butchery and setup-butchery.command files in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-butchery.command`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-butchery.command`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Linux

The BuTcHeRy for Linux is distributed in the same compressed archive and does not include a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.

Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases">WeiDU.org</a> and copy weidu and weinstall to `/usr/bin`. Following that, open a terminal, **cd** to your game installation directory, run tolower and answer 'Y' to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.

To install, run **`weinstall setup-butchery`** in your game folder. Then run **`wine bgmain.exe`** (or **`wine baldur.exe`** for EE games) and start playing.

## 

#### Note for Complete Un-installation

In addition to the methods above for removing individual components, you can completely un-install the mod using **`setup-butchery --uninstall`** at the command line to remove all components without wading through prompts.<br>

## <a name="components" id="components"></a>Components

The installer includes the following components. The number of each is the component `DESIGNATED` number which gives it a fixed install position, lets other components detect it and allows automated installers to specify component choices.

#### &#10173; Difficulty level scaling:

This is the major latest mod improvement. I know that it can be frustrating to have a too much difficult -or easy- fight, so this new possibility will surely be appreciated. The numbers and variety of opponents are now adjusted according to the game difficulty level which can be set in the Gameplay subsection of the Options menu. These adjustments are reflected as follows:

- <ins>Core Rules</ins>: normal and decent amount of enemies (no divine or arcane enemies spellcasters).
- <ins>Difficult</ins>: a bit more numerous enemies and especially divine/arcane enemies spellcasters.
- <ins>Very difficult</ins>: again, a bit more enemies and a even more divine/arcane enemies spellcasters.

Be aware that even with Core Rules, the challenge might be quite difficult (especially before Underdark) because this mod adresses to players looking for a better challenge. :wink:

------------------------

<a name="10" id="10"></a>&#10173; **[10] DrAzTiK's revisited fight against Tazok and DigDag**
###### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>install before Stratagems</em><br><br>

This is the very first component, and the genesis of this mod.

I have always found the fight against Tazok and DigDag in Firkraag's Hideout nothing more than a pathetic joke. Obviously, Firkaag is supposed to be an optional boss (like the shadow dragon) surely unbeatable before Underdark. All banters and interjections suppose the party want to escape in front of Firkraag without thinking twice and come back later, really later.

So I assume Tazok and DigDag are supposed to be the big vilains in Firkaag's lair and IMO the fight deserves to be a bit more challenging and fun. The fight vs Tazok and DigDag will now take place where you usually fight Firkraag (AR1203). Don't worry, you will be also able to fight Firkraag. This component doesn't modify or tweak creatures at all except:

- DigDag gets a new script, letting him have some new dialogs and drink 2 potions before fighting.
- Tazok gets a new script, allowing him to drink 2 potions before fighting.

This component also adds some of my customs creatures and especially two fighters of my own composition. Their duty is to protect Tazok and DigDag during the final fight.

:warning: <ins>Note for English language players</ins>: Two new creatures get their own soundsets, unfortunately only available in French. But they have been traified as for the latest version &#128521; and they are still waiting for their English sound files. If anyone would provide them, I would be pleased to include them in the next version. &#128578;

<a name="12" id="11"></a>&#10173; **[11] Rebalancing some generic creatures**
###### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>install before Stratagems</em><br><br>

&#9755;</span> This component improves stats, saving throws, hit points and skill points of a few generic creatures (orc and ogre fighters at the beginning, and many animals and other creatures as of version 5.0.0). Most of them have now a barbarian or berserker kit, a weapon which suits their avatars, etc. but I often keep their vanilla level. But you will need to install Stratagems for these creatures to use their special abilities.

Enemy skeletons and mummies' abilities are standardised: they still have 100% resistance to electricity and cold and 10% magic resistance per level. Their resistance to missile attacks is 90%. This makes them fearsome foes.

In addition, some of the "half-bosses" have had their combat stats and equipment upgraded a bit (Ilyich in particular).

</table><br>

Except high scores in STR and CON, these creatures have now the same features and obey the same rules as other humanoids (thac0, saves, hit point, kit bonus etc..), except they remain a bit slow, have an incredible moral and a good AC.

You will find mostly theses creatures only in Windspear Hills and in Firkraag's Hideout. I also added a lot of them in my mod (the reason why I wrote this component).

I didn't modify vanilla fighting scripts at all. So if you don't install Stratagems '*Smarter general AI*' component, theses creatures will not use their kit abilities.

<a name="12" id="12"></a>&#10173; **[12] Rebalancing Rebalancing Tazok and DigDa**
###### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>install before Stratagems</em><br><br>

&#9755; In vanilla, Tazok is an ORC Level 18 standard fighter, and DigDag an ORC level 12 standard fighter. This component tweaks Tazok lightly (slightly better saving thrown and hp), turns DigDag into a Berserker, and improves their levels by one (level 19 for Tazok and 13 for DigDag). It is also cosmetic: Tazok is now a half ogre again (as in BG1) while DigDag inherits the OROG CHIEFTAIN animation.

If you want Tazok to be a berseker, you must install stratagems '*Smarter general AI*' component (no problem of compatibility issue).

Equipment, stats and proficiencies are tweaked a bit, especially DigDag's ones.

##### Version 4.0.0 &nbsp;(October 20, 2018)

- General overhaul and relooking:

	- Integrated all BWP Fixpack patches: <a href="http://www.shsforums.net/topic/42220-fixes-for-the-big-fixpack/?p=524893">Lollorian's override compilation fix</a> (changes `COMPILE xyz.d/baf override` to `COMPILE xyz.d/baf`) and unknown origin patch that set ORC05.CRE's BG1 Long Swords proficiency to 0.
	- Provided full compatibility with Stratagems and Item Revisions.
	- tp2 split into components and commented for easier further updates.
	- Reorganized components (`DESIGNATED` numbers).
	- Added BG2EE compatibility (probably with EET, but not yet tested).

	- No longer overwrites mod item files if there are already installed.
	- Used new WeiDU variables (INV RING QITEM...) with `ADD_CRE_ITEM` command.
	- Provided new portraits for BG2:EE.
	- Reworked install procedure to use WeiDU's built-in `HANDLE_AUDIO` function to install soundsets.

	- Removed unused files from mod folder.
	- Updated readme (Butchery now supports translated readmes)
	- Revamped French translation and fixed English typos courtesy of Gwendolyne.
	- Traified creatures soundsets (still waiting for English sound files).
	- Reorganized and merged tra files into 3 files.
	- Updated WeiDU installer to v246.
